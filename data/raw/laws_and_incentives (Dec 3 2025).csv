347,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for State and Alternative Fuel Provider Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, as amended, certain state
government and alternative fuel provider fleets are required to acquire
alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) as a portion of their annual light-duty
vehicle acquisitions. Compliance is required by fleets that operate,
lease, or control 50 or more light-duty vehicles within the United
States. Of those 50 vehicles, at least 20 must be used primarily within
a single Metropolitan Statistical Area/Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area, and those same 20 vehicles must also be capable of
being centrally fueled for the fleet to be subject to the regulatory
requirements.

Under [Standard
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/standard-compliance), the AFVs that
covered fleets acquire help them achieve compliance, with each AFV
acquired earning the fleet one AFV-acquisition credit. Covered fleets
may earn additional credits for AFVs earned in excess of their
requirements, and these credits may be banked for future use toward
compliance or traded with other fleets. Additionally, fleets that use
fuel blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) in medium- and
heavy-duty vehicles may earn credits toward their annual AFV-acquisition
requirements. A fleet may also earn credits that may be used toward
compliance or banked once the fleet achieves compliance for investments
in alternative fuel infrastructure, mobile non-road equipment, and
emerging technologies associated with certain electric drive vehicle
technologies.

Fleets may also opt into [Alternative
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/alternative-compliance), which
allows fleets the option to choose a petroleum reduction path in lieu of
acquiring AFVs under Standard Compliance. Interested fleets must obtain
from DOE a waiver from Standard Compliance by submitting a plan that
demonstrates a path by which they will achieve a certain level of
petroleum reduction specific to their fleet composition.

357,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for Federal Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, 75% of new light-duty
vehicles acquired by covered federal fleets must be alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs). As amended in January 2008, Section 301 of EPAct 1992
expands the definition of AFVs to include hybrid electric vehicles, fuel
cell vehicles, and advanced lean burn vehicles. Fleets that use fuel
blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) may earn credits toward
their annual requirements. Federal fleets are also required to use
alternative fuels in dual-fuel vehicles unless the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) approves waivers for agency vehicles; grounds for a waiver
include lack of alternative fuel availability and unreasonable cost (per
EPAct 2005, section 701).

Additional requirements for federal fleets were included in the [Energy
Independence and Security Act of
2007](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/eisa), such as fleet management
plans and petroleum reduction from 2005 levels (Section 142), low
greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting vehicle acquisition requirements (Section
141), and renewable fuel infrastructure installation requirements
(Section 246). For more information, see the [Federal Fleet
Management](https://federalfleets.energy.gov/) website.

To track progress toward meeting AFV acquisition and fuel use
requirements, federal fleets must report on their percent alternative
fuel increase compared to the fiscal year 2005 baseline, alternative
fuel use as a percentage of total fuel consumption, AFV acquisitions as
a percentage of vehicle acquisitions, and fleet-wide miles per gasoline
gallon equivalent of petroleum fuels.

Executive Order 13834, issued in May 2018, requires the Secretary of
Energy (Secretary), in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the
Administrator of General Services, and the heads of other agencies as
appropriate, to review the existing federal vehicle fleet requirements.
In April 2019, the Secretary provided a report to the Chairman of the
Council on Environmental Quality and the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget detailing opportunities to optimize federal fleet
performance, reduce associated costs, and streamline reporting and
compliance requirements. Specifically, the report recommends that
federal agencies identify and implement strategies to:

-   Right-size the fleet
-   Reduce vehicle miles traveled
-   Implement more fuel efficient vehicles
-   Align the implementation of AFVs and associated fueling
    infrastructure

Executive Order 14008, issued in January 2021, requires the Chair of the
Council on Environmental Quality, the Administrator of General Services,
and the Director of the Office and Management and Budget, in
coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the
Secretary, and the heads of other relevant agencies, to assist the
National Climate Advisor in developing a comprehensive plan to
facilitate clean and zero-emission vehicles for federal, state, local,

Energy (DOE) was directed to determine whether private and local
government fleets should be mandated to acquire alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs). In January 2004, DOE published a final rule announcing
its decision not to implement an AFV acquisition mandate for private and
local government fleets. In response to a March 2006 ruling by a U.S.
District Court, DOE issued a subsequent final rulemaking on the new
Replacement Fuel Goal in March 2007, which extended the EPAct 1992 goal
to 2030. The goal is to achieve a domestic production capacity for
replacement fuels sufficient to replace 30% of the U.S. motor fuel
consumption. In March 2008, DOE issued its determination not to
implement a fleet compliance mandate for private and local government

385,US,Vehicle Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Standards,"Vehicle manufacturers must meet fuel economy and GHG emissions standards
for vehicles sold in the United States. The U.S. Department of
Transportation's (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) regulates fuel economy standards, while the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) regulates GHG emissions.

NHTSA's Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program and EPA's
light-duty vehicle GHG emissions program set standards for passenger
cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles. By Model
Year (MY) 2025, these vehicles must meet an estimated combined average
fuel economy of 48.7 to 49.7 miles per gallon or higher. The standards
provide flexibility to manufacturers, including the ability to earn
credits for alternative fuel vehicles. For information on the standards
from MY 2017 to 2025, see the [final
rule](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-10-15/pdf/2012-21972.pdf) in
the Federal Register.

Additionally, fuel efficiency standards will increase by 2% per year for
MY 2027 to 2031 passenger vehicles and MY 2029 to 2031 light-duty
trucks. For more information on the standards from MY 2027 to 2031, see
the NHTSA [final
rule](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-06/CAFE-2027-2031-HDPUV-2030-2035_Final-Rule_web_0.pdf).

NHTSA and EPA also regulate fuel economy and GHG emissions for on-road
vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 8,500 pounds or
greater and the engines that power them. For MY 2014 to 2018 medium- and
heavy-duty vehicles that are not already covered by the standards
described above, manufacturers must meet increasingly stringent fuel
economy and GHG emissions standards tailored to each of three main
regulatory subcategories: combination tractors (also known as semi
trucks); heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans; and vocational vehicles
(such as delivery, refuse, and tow trucks; transit, shuttle, and school
buses; and emergency vehicles). The standards provide flexibility,
allowing for emissions and/or fuel consumption credits to be averaged,
banked, or traded. For more information, refer to the [final

390,US,Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program,"The national RFS Program was developed to increase the volume of
renewable fuel that is blended into transportation fuels. As required by
the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) finalized RFS Program regulations, effective September 1, 2007.
The [Energy Independence and Security Act of
2007](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/laws/eisa) (EISA) increased and
expanded this standard. By 2022, 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel
must be blended into domestic transportation fuels each year. A certain
percentage of this renewable fuel must be advanced biofuel, which
includes fuels derived from approved renewable biomass, excluding corn
starch-based ethanol. Other advanced biofuels may include
sugarcane-based fuels, renewable diesel co-processed with petroleum, and
other biofuels that may exist in the future. All advanced biofuels must
achieve a minimum of a 50% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction
compared to baseline petroleum emissions. Nested within advanced
biofuels are two sub-categories: cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based
diesel, both of which have their own percentage requirements. Cellulosic
biofuel is defined as any renewable fuel derived from cellulose,
hemicellulose, or lignin that achieves a 60% GHG emissions reduction.
Biomass-based diesel is defined as a renewable transportation fuel,
transportation fuel additive, heating oil, or jet fuel, such as
biodiesel or non-ester renewable diesel, and achieves a 50% GHG
emissions reduction. If intended for use in a motor vehicle, the fuel
must also be registered with EPA as a motor vehicle fuel or fuel
additive.

Each year, EPA determines the annual percentage standards by dividing
the annual amount of renewable fuel (gallons) required by EISA for each
renewable fuel pathway by the amount of highway and non-road gasoline
and petroleum diesel estimated to be supplied that year. These
percentages are then applied to obligated parties' actual fuel sales to
determine their Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO). Any party that
produces gasoline for use in the United States, including refiners,
importers, and blenders (other than oxygenate blenders), is considered
an obligated party under the RFS Program. Parties that do not produce,
import, or market fuels within the 48 contiguous states are exempt from
the renewable fuel tracking program.

To facilitate and track compliance with the RFS, a producer or importer
of renewable fuel must generate Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs)
to represent renewable fuels produced or imported by the entity on or
after September 1, 2007, assigned by gallon or batch. Assigned RINs are
transferred when ownership of a batch of fuel occurs, but not when fuel
only changes custody. A trading program is in place to allow obligated
parties to comply with their annual RVO requirements through the
purchase of RINs. Obligated parties must register with EPA in order to
participate in the trading program. For each calendar year, an obligated
party must demonstrate that it has sufficient RINs to cover its RVO.
RINs may only be used for compliance purposes in the calendar year they
are generated or the following year. Obligated parties must report their
ownership of RINs to EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality on a
quarterly and annual basis.

Vehicles Placed in Service on or After April 18, 2023
-----------------------------------------------------

For vehicles delivered on or after April 18, 2023, limitations apply
that went into effect January 1, 2023, related to the vehicle's
manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP), the buyer's modified
adjusted gross income, and the vehicle's battery capacity. A North
American final assembly requirement applies for vehicles purchased on or
after August 17, 2022. Additional critical mineral and battery component
requirements also apply as of April 18, 2023, which alter how the tax
credit is calculated and may alter the amount of the tax credit
available. These latter requirements came into effect upon the
publication of the Treasury Department's guidance document regarding the
critical mineral and battery component requirements. Vehicles that meet
the critical mineral requirements are eligible for a \$3,750 tax credit,
and vehicles that meet the battery component requirements are eligible
for a \$3,750 tax credit. Vehicles meeting both the critical mineral and
the battery component requirements are eligible for a total tax credit
of \$7,500.

Vans, sport utility vehicles, and pickup trucks must not have an MSRP
above \$80,000, and all other vehicles may not have an MSRP above
\$55,000. The MSRP can be found on the vehicle's window sticker, which
is also known as the ""Monroney label""; the MSRP for this purpose
includes any trim, options, or accessories for the particular vehicle
and excludes the destination fee and dealer-provided options and
accessories.

Additionally, a taxpayer's eligibility for the tax credit may be limited
by thresholds for modified adjusted gross income (modified AGI); only
individuals having a modified AGI below the following thresholds for the
current tax year or the prior tax year are eligible for the tax credit:

-   \$300,000 for joint filers
-   \$225,000 for head-of-household filers
-   \$150,000 for all other filers

To be eligible for the Clean Vehicle Credit, the battery powering the
vehicle must have a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours (kWh). The
amount of the credit depends on whether the vehicle meets certain
critical minerals and battery component requirements.

**Critical Minerals:** To be eligible for the \$3,750 critical minerals
portion of the tax credit, the percentage of the value of the battery's
critical minerals that are extracted or processed in the United States
or a U.S. free-trade agreement partner or recycled in North America,

Vehicles Sold on or After January 1 and Placed-in-Service Before April 18, 2023
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginning January 1, 2023, the Clean Vehicle Credit (CVC) provisions
removed the manufacturer sales caps for vehicles sold after January 1,
2023, expanded the scope of eligible vehicles to include both EVs and
FCEVs, and required that the battery powering the vehicle has a capacity
of at least seven kilowatt-hours (kWh). An available tax credit under
the CVC may be limited by the vehicle's manufacturer suggested retail
price (MSRP) and the buyer's modified adjusted gross income (as
addressed above). The North American final assembly requirement
continues to apply.

For vehicles placed in service before April 18, 2023, the available CVC
tax credit is a base amount of \$2,500 plus, for a vehicle that draws
propulsion energy from a battery with at least 7 kWh of capacity, \$417,
plus an additional \$417 for each kilowatt hour of battery capacity
beyond 5 kWh. The total tax credit available for a vehicle may not
exceed \$7,500.

Vehicles Purchased Between August 17 and December 31, 2022
----------------------------------------------------------

Qualifying EVs purchased and delivered between August 17, 2022, and
December 31, 2022, are eligible for the tax incentive as described below
for vehicles purchased before August 17, 2022, but are limited to
[vehicles with final assembly in North
America](https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxcenter.shtml). Manufacturer
sales caps on vehicles apply. Note that for some manufacturers, the
assembly location may vary because some models are produced in multiple
locations. The assembly location of a particular vehicle should be
confirmed by referring to its Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) using
the U.S. Department of Transportation's [VIN
decoder](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vin-decoder) or an information label
affixed to the vehicle.

Vehicles Purchased Before August 17, 2022
-----------------------------------------

Qualifying EVs purchased before August 17, 2022, are eligible for a tax
credit that is available for the purchase of a new qualified EV that
draws propulsion from a battery that has at least five kilowatt-hours
(kWh) of capacity, uses an external source of energy to charge the
battery, has a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 14,000 pounds, and
meets specified emission standards. The minimum credit amount is
\$2,500, and the credit may be up to \$7,500 based on each vehicle's
traction battery capacity. The credit will begin to be phased out for
each manufacturer in the second quarter following the calendar quarter
in which a minimum of 200,000 qualified PEVs have been sold by that
manufacturer for use in the United States. This tax credit is also
available for future EV owners with a written binding contract to
purchase a new qualifying electric vehicle before August 16, 2022, but
do not take possession of the vehicle until on or after August 16, 2022.

4249,CA,Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Production Requirements,"The California Air Resources Board (CARB) certifies new passenger cars,
light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles as ZEVs if the
vehicles produce zero exhaust emissions of any criteria pollutant (or
precursor pollutant) under all possible operational modes and
conditions. Manufacturers with annual sales between 4,501 and 60,000
vehicles may comply with the ZEV requirements through multiple
alternative compliance options that include producing low emission
vehicles and obtaining ZEV credits. Manufacturers with annual sales of
4,500 vehicles or less are not subject to this regulation.

CARB's emissions control program for model year (MY) 2017 through 2025
combines the control of smog, soot, and greenhouse gases (GHGs) and
requirements for ZEVs into a single package of standards called Advanced
Clean Cars (ACC). In December 2012, CARB finalized new regulatory
requirements that allow vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) GHG requirements for MY 2017
through 2025 to serve as compliance with California's adopted GHG
emissions requirements for those same model years.

The accounting procedures for MY 2018 through 2025 are based on a credit
system as shown in the table below. The minimum ZEV requirement for each
manufacturer includes the percentage of passenger cars and light-duty
trucks produced by the manufacturer and delivered for sale in
California. The regulation also includes opportunities for compliance
with transitional ZEVs, which must demonstrate certain exhaust emissions
standards, evaporative emissions standards, on-board diagnostic
requirements, and extended warranties.

Ethanol is defined an ethyl alcohol that has a purity of at least 99%,
exclusive of added denaturants; meets U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms, and Explosives; meets all the requirements of ASTM D4806; and
is produced from domestic agricultural or biomass products. This

federal alcohol fuel mixture tax credits, is equal to or below the
average wholesale price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in
Louisiana for a period of not less than 60 days, as determined by the

Within six months following the point at which monthly production of
biodiesel produced in the state equals or exceeds a minimum annualized
production volume of 10 million gallons, at least 2% of the total diesel
sold by volume in the state must be biodiesel produced from domestically
grown feedstock. Biodiesel is a fuel comprised of mono-alkyl esters of
long chain fatty acids derived from renewable resources and meeting the
requirements of ASTM specification D6751, or a diesel fuel substitute
produced from non-petroleum renewable resources, such as vegetable oils
and animal fats, that meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fuel and
fuel additive requirements.

Alternatively, these requirements may be met through the production of
an alternate renewable fuel, defined as a liquid fuel that is
domestically produced from renewable biomass, can be used in place of
ethanol or biodiesel, and meets the definition of renewable fuel in the
Energy Policy Act of 2005. Within six months following the point at
which cumulative monthly production of an alternate renewable fuel
capable of substituting for ethanol and biodiesel produced in the state
equals or exceeds a minimum annual production volume of 20 million
gallons, at least 2% of the total motor fuel sold by volume in the state
must be the alternate renewable fuel produced from domestically grown
feedstock. This requirement may not exceed 2% of the total motor fuel
sold by volume by owners or operators of fuel distribution terminals.

Blenders and retailers will have six months to meet the new minimum
ethanol, biodiesel, or alternate renewable fuel content requirement. The
Louisiana Commission of Weights and Measures may waive or extend the six
month time period if the quality or supply of ethanol or biodiesel in
the state is insufficient to meet the minimum content requirements, or
fuel distributors are unable to blend ethanol due to delays in obtaining
permits or constructing ethanol blending or storage equipment. Fuels
containing ethanol or biodiesel will not be required to be sold in ozone
nonattainment areas. The Commissioner will adopt rules and regulations
requiring incentives to compensate for any costs associated with
achieving the minimum ethanol and biodiesel standards.

The Department defines domestically grown feedstock to include any
feedstock produced in the United States. Because in-state volume
requirements are currently being met through the U.S. [Renewable Fuel

emissions standards and encourage the purchase or lease of
fuel-efficient and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). Specifically, DGS
must reduce or displace the fleet's consumption of petroleum products by
20% by January 1, 2020, as compared to the 2003 consumption level. DGS
must also ensure that at least 50% of the light-duty vehicles purchased
by the state are zero emission vehicles (ZEVs). Further, at least 15% of
DGS' fleet of new vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 19,000
pounds or more must be ZEVs by 2025, and at least 30% by 2030.

On an annual basis, DGS must compile information including, but not
limited to, the number of AFVs and hybrid electric vehicles acquired,
the locations of the alternative fuel pumps available for those
vehicles, and the total amount of alternative fuels used. Vehicles the
state owns or leases that are capable of operating on alternative fuel
must operate on that fuel unless the alternative fuel is not available.
DGS is also required to:

-   Take steps to transfer vehicles between agencies and departments to
    ensure that the most fuel-efficient vehicles are used and to
    eliminate the least fuel-efficient vehicles from the state's motor
    vehicle fleet;
-   Submit annual progress reports to the California Department of
    Finance, related legislative committees, and the general public via
    the [DGS](https://www.dgs.ca.gov/) website;

6493,CA,Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Standards,"California's LEV II exhaust emissions standards apply to Model Year (MY)
2004 and subsequent model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and
medium-duty passenger vehicles meeting specified exhaust standards. The
LEV II standards represent the maximum exhaust emissions for LEVs, Ultra
LEVs, and Super Ultra LEVs, including flexible fuel, bi-fuel, and
dual-fuel vehicles when operating on an alternative fuel. MY 2009 and
subsequent model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty
passenger vehicles must meet specified fleet average greenhouse gas
(GHG) exhaust emissions requirements. Each manufacturer must comply with
these fleet average GHG requirements, which are based on California Air
Resources Board (CARB) calculations. Bi-fuel, flexible fuel, dual-fuel,
and grid-connected hybrid electric vehicles may be eligible for an
alternative compliance method when operating on gasoline.

In December 2012, CARB finalized regulatory requirements, referred to as
LEV III, which allow vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's GHG requirements for MY 2017-2025 to
serve as compliance with California's adopted GHG emissions requirements
for those same model years.

In November 2022, CARB approved LEV IV standards, which updates
regulations for light- and medium-duty internal combustion engine
vehicles by reducing allowable exhaust emissions and emissions caused by
evaporation. LEV IV also changes the calculation procedure for new
vehicle fleet-average emissions and prohibits zero emissions vehicles
from being considered in fleet-average emissions calculations by MY
2029.

commercialization of ZEVs in California. In particular, the Air
Resources Board, the California Energy Commission (CEC), the Public
Utilities Commission, and other relevant state agencies must work with
the private sector to establish benchmarks to achieve targets for ZEV
commercialization and deployment. These targets include:

-   By 2020, the state will have established adequate infrastructure to
    support one million ZEVs;
-   By 2025, there will be over 1.5 million ZEVs on the road in
    California and clean, efficient vehicles will displace 1.5 billion
    gallons of petroleum fuels annually;
-   By 2025, there will be 200 hydrogen fueling stations and 250,000
    electric vehicle (EV) chargers, including 10,000 direct current (DC)
    fast chargers, in California;
-   By 2030, there will be at least 5 million ZEVs on the road in
    California; and
-   By 2050, greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector
    will be 80% less than 1990 levels.

State agencies must also work with their stakeholders to accomplish the
following:

-   Develop new criteria for clean vehicle incentive programs to
    encourage manufacturers to produce clean, affordable cars;
-   Update the 2016 ZEV Action plan, with a focus on low income and
    disadvantaged communities;
-   Recommend actions to increase the deployment of ZEV infrastructure
    through the Low Carbon Fuel Standard;
-   Support and recommend policies that will facilitate the installation
    of EV chargers in homes and businesses; and
-   Ensure EV charging and hydrogen fueling are affordable and
    accessible to all drivers.

The ZEV promotion plan additionally directs the state fleet to increase
the number of ZEVs in the fleet through gradual vehicle replacement. By
2020, ZEVs should make up at least 25% of the fleet's light-duty
vehicles. Vehicles with special performance requirements necessary for
public safety and welfare are exempt from this requirement. For more

regulations that would require a supplier to construct, operate, or
provide funding to construct or operate a publicly available hydrogen
fueling station.

Annually, CARB must aggregate and share the number of hydrogen vehicles
that manufacturers project will be sold or leased over the next three
years and the total number of hydrogen vehicle registered in the state.
Based on this information, CARB must evaluate the need for additional
publicly available hydrogen fueling stations for the subsequent three
years and report findings to the California Energy Commission (CEC)
including the of number of stations, geographic areas where stations are
needed, and minimum operating standards, such as number of dispensers
and filling pressures.

The CEC will allocate no less than 15% of the moneys appropriated by the
Legislature from the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle
Technology Fund per year to fund the number of stations deemed necessary
based on CARB's evaluation and reports. The CEC may stop funding new
stations if it determines, in consultation with CARB, that the private
sector is developing publicly available stations without the need for
government support.

The CEC and CARB must issue an annual report on progress toward
establishing a hydrogen fueling station network that meets the needs of
vehicles being used in the state. CARB may also design grants,
incentives, loan programs, and other forms of financial assistance to
assist in program implementation. For more information see CARB's

national highway system corridors. To designate these Alternative Fuel
Corridors (AFC), FHWA solicits nominations from state and local
officials and works with other federal officials and industry
stakeholders.

FHWA established an AFC [grant
program](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12730) to award grants to eligible
entities. During the designation and redesignation process, in
consultation with the U.S. Department of Energy, FHWA will issue a
report identifying charging and fueling infrastructure, best practices
and guidance for predictable infrastructure deployment, analyzing
standardization needs for fuel providers and purchasers, and
reestablishing the goal of achieving strategic deployment of fueling
infrastructure in the designated corridors.

The RFN and AFC designation for Round 7 and beyond is tied to funding
eligibility under the [NEVI Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling
Infrastructure Discretionary Grant
Program](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12744). The FHWA encourages
nominations that focus on EV charging infrastructure along Interstate
corridors, but nominations may also be submitted elsewhere on the
National Highway System. Corridor projects along Round 7 AFCs and beyond
are not eligible for the [Charging and Fueling Infrastructure

In September 2021, the Commissioner of Community Affairs (Commissioner)
published a model land use ordinance to address installation, sightline,
setback requirements, and other health- and safety-related
specifications for EV chargers and make-ready parking spaces and posted
the [model land use
ordinance](https://www.nj.gov/dca/dlps/home/modelEVordinance.shtml) on
the department's website. Requirements include the following:

-   A parking space with an EV charger or make-ready equipment may count
    as two parking spaces for the purpose of complying with a minimum
    parking space requirement but may not reduce total required parking
    by more than 10 percent.
-   All parking space calculations for EV chargers and make-ready
    equipment pursuant to this section shall be rounded up to the next
    full parking space.

The model land use ordinance applies to all municipalities in New
Jersey, but municipalities may adopt reasonable standards to address
installation, sightline, and setback requirements or other health- and
safety-related specifications for EV charging stations and make-ready
parking spaces. Municipalities may not require more make-ready parking
spaces than the land use ordinance published by the Commissioner.
